# 0017 - Access Guard in Pilot

* **Status**: proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

The service should not be public until it has achieved authority to operate. This will not happen until
after the completion and acceptance of the private Beta phase, when the service is ready to move to
public Beta.

Because it is a public service, there is no authentication or user recognition functionality. Some
other means is therefore necessary to remove the service from public view, and prevent its indexing
by search engines.

It is also true that development and test deployments of the service will _always_ need to be hidden
from public view. 

## Decision Drivers

- No requirement to implement authentication solution
- Users can be authorised to access a non-public instance of the service
- Authorisation secret can be changed
- Authorisation can be easily switched off in production environments
    - â€¦but left on in lower environments

## Considered Options

- Authentication solution
- IP allow list
- Application Gateway configuration
- Challenge page for secret to be shared with permitted users

Implementing an authentication solution is overkill for this requirement.

IP allow lists, and Application Gateway configuration, would be onerous to maintain. (For instance,
before a round of User Research it might be necessary to configure a whole tranche of individual
user filtering criteria, which would then have to be reconfigured "off" at the end of the round.)

A challenge page would be relatively easy to implement (action filter on all controllers),
configure (a single "secret value" configuration), change (edit the secret value config),
turn off (on/off configuration), and share with users (a single value for them to enter).

## Decision Outcome

Challenge page. All other pages to redirect to the challenge page until user has entered
configurable secret value. Once user has entered secret value, other areas of the service
are all accessible.
