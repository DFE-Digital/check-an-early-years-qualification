## Dfe.EarlyYearsQualification.Web
### Requirements
- .Net 8

### Development Setup

#### Azure environment variables
- In order for the application to be run locally, you need to add the Dev Service Principal client id and secret to your launchSettings.json file
Replace the environment variables object in the http profile with the following:
```
"environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "AZURE_TENANT_ID": "<TENANT_ID>",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_ID": "<CLIENT_ID>",
        "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET": "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
      }
```
Speak to one of the developers about getting the values for the above settings.

#### Contentful Setup
- We are using [dotnet user-secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-8.0) to manage the contentful secrets.
- We have a .sh script called ```set-contentful-secrets.sh``` that will help you set these up. Go to the Contentful space to get access to the: Delivery API Key, Preview API Key and Space ID.
- Run this script and copy paste the keys in and you're all set!

## Unit testing

To run the unit tests locally make sure you are in the root directory and then you can use the following command:
```
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverlet.runsettings
```

This will pull in the exclusions such as the .cshtml files and will replicate coverage in the GitHub Actions.

## End to end/Smoke testing

End to end tests are ran using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

To run the tests, run the following commands:
- Run the local web app.
- Navigate to the correct folder, be it:
  - ``cd tests/Dfe.EarlyYearsQualification.E2ETests/playwright`` for the E2E tests.
  - ``cd tests/Dfe.EarlyYearsQualification.SmokeTests/playwright`` for the smoke tests.
- Tell Node Version Manager that you want the latest version with: ``nvm use node --lts``
- Run the tests with: ``npx playwright test``

### Problems with Safari?
If you notice you are having issues with running Safari tests locally and them failing then there is a fix.

This is happening due to because Safari strictly enforcing the `upgrade-insecure-requests` header. This is converting the HTTP requests to HTTPS.

To fix this, comment out this line in the web app's [Program.cs](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/check-an-early-years-qualification/blob/main/src/Dfe.EarlyYearsQualification.Web/Program.cs#L138-L140). This will remove the header from all requests and should let Safari use HTTP.
